                   I began my journey as a BSc Computer Science student at College Of Applied Science Pattuvam in 2015. Along the way, I fearlessly explored various fields, including Web Development, Data Structure, Photoshop, and Video Editing. In my previous role at Cisoft Technologies, I contributed to testing and developing in-house ERP software for schools and colleges. Additionally, I played a key role in developing school websites and automating live reports.

                    I am particularly drawn to Brototype's commitment to cutting-edge projects. I delved into the world of cutting-edge technologies, such as JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, AWS, and Redux. I have built projects in the MERN stack, E-commerce, and social media platforms, as well as numerous mini-projects.

                    I've worked for many projects for my clients as well as my personal projects. I also contributed for the GDSC RKMGEC web page. I have a Instagram page (@codewithbiki) where I create content for those who are just starting with programming and have more that 70k followers. I have learning attitude and growth mindset which helps me to collaborate with people and work for the society.
